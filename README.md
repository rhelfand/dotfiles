# dotfiles
A simple repo for me to keep my dotfiles.  I use Stow so I don't have to do anything crazy with
copying around files.  I try to make this as OS agnostic as possible, but I focus on Linux and
MacOS which is primarily what I use.

To install, simply clone the repository and run:
  bash ./bootstrap.sh
